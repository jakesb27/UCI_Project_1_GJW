## California Wildfire Analysis

### - SUMMARY -
This exploratory data analysis takes a look at a dataset based on a database from the United States Forest Service of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2020. The dataset consists only of wildfires that occurred in the State of California from 2001 to 2020. The analysis focuses on the number of acres burned, the causes, and the geographic distribution of wildfires in California during that period, and generates scatter, line, and pie plots as well as maps that have plotted wildfires along the northern and southern halves of California, showing their relative size and their cause through point size and color.
